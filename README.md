# USM-eM
A new full rom hack for Smash 3DS (and Wii U coming soon), inspired by Project M and Melee.  Changes include **character and gameplay changes that match Melee closely**, as well as a handful of extras like **Stages, SFX and Music, Skins, and more!** Every single character will have balance changes eventually, but currently every character is affected by global changes such as **increased gravity, altered ledge mechanics, dash dancing, and more** but only a few characters have been changed completely.
